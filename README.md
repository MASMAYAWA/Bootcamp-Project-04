# Introduction
HIV/AIDS remains a significant global health challenge, and early detection of progression from HIV to AIDS is crucial for effective treatment and management. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting HIV progression to AIDS.  

# Methodology
1.    Data Cleaning and Transformation:  
Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
Transform categorical variables and standardize numerical features for model compatibility.  
2.    Data Visualization:  
Explore the dataset using visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of features and relationships between variables.  
Identify patterns that may inform feature selection and model design.  
3.    Model Development and Evaluation:  
Implement multiple machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Random Forest, SVM, KNN and Logistic Regression models.  
Train and validate each model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Compare the performance of each model based on evaluation metrics to determine the most effective approach.  

# Expected Outcome:  
A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting HIV progression to AIDS.  
Comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms for HIV/AIDS classification.  
Recommendations for healthcare practitioners and policymakers based on model insights.
